You maintain docs/TODO.md for the task runner in scripts/todo-runner/run-todos.sh. The script parses this file, so the format below is a contract: break it and the runner silently skips tasks.

Inputs (read only these): docs/TODO.md, the "Where we stand" and "Gotchas" sections of docs/HANDOVER.md, `git log --oneline -30`, `git status`, and any notes I paste below. Do not read the rest of the repo except the files you need to name in a task.

Do this:
1. Mark done what the commits show is done (flip `[ ]` to `[x]`). Check the code before you tick: a task is done only if its "Done when" holds.
2. Turn each new goal or owner decision into bite-size tasks. A task is one commit, one session, ideally under 20 agent turns. If a goal needs more than about 3 files or two independent changes, split it.
3. Give each task exactly one line:
   `- [ ] T<nn> [auto|human|owner] {haiku|sonnet|opus} <imperative title>. Files: <exact paths, with line numbers where useful>. Docs: <doc path#section>. Test pattern: <nearest existing test file>. Done when: <one checkable condition>.`
   - Ids are never reused or renumbered. Take the next free number in its priority block.
   - `[auto]` only if tests and the build can verify it with no browser, device or judgment. Otherwise `[human]` (needs eyes on a real browser or device) or `[owner]` (needs a decision; put the question in the line).
   - Model tag: haiku for mechanical work (tests, docs, deletions, timeouts); sonnet for sim, render or multi-file changes; opus only for design work, with the reason in the line. Untagged means haiku. `{...}` tags go on [auto] tasks only.
   - Paths must be exact. If you cannot name the start files, open the code and find them. A vague Files field makes the agent search, which is where the cost goes.
   - Use `[~]` for deferred or blocked tasks and say why and who decided, with the date.
4. Keep the Rules and Tags sections at the top unchanged unless I ask. Keep priority blocks (P0, P1, ...) and put new tasks in the right one.
5. Do not run, change or commit anything except docs/TODO.md. Commit it as one commit: "Docs: update TODO (<what changed>)".
6. Finish with: tasks ticked, tasks added, tasks blocked on me, and the exact command to run the next batch of [auto] tasks.

Notes from me: <paste decisions, new goals, or "none">
